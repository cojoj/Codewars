In this repo you can find solutions to the katas I've done on a great platform called [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

### But... Why? ðŸ¤”

To keep myself around the other languages _I know_. In work I mostly use one language and I'm productive in it, but there are pleanty of languages I used in the past, but since I don't have to use them right now, I tend to forget them ðŸ˜… 
It's a known [issue](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-bilingual/201103/language-forgetting) in learning foreign languages, but I think we can relate this to programming languages as well.

As you can see... This is my way of fighting this problem. It's not perfect, but it's something and I'm happy with it!
