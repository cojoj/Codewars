In this repo you can find solutions to the katas I've done on a great platform called [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
If you don't know what Codewars is (well, you should by now), it's a platform on which you have a lot of different tasks/problems to solve. You simply write a solution to problem in the language of choice and upload it to their server, so they can run tests against this code.
Mostly, you can find _short_ tasks there, so you can actually spend as little time as possible, but still take care of your multi-language knowledge.
This platform is also a great place for learning new languages... You can grab introductory tutorial somewhere on the Internet, and than star doing katas in this language, to reach the full active experience in this programming language.

## But... Why? ü§î

To keep myself around the other languages _I know_. In work I mostly use one language and I'm productive in it, but there are pleanty of languages I used in the past, but since I don't have to use them right now, I tend to forget them üòÖ 
It's a known [issue](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-bilingual/201103/language-forgetting) in learning foreign languages, but I think we can relate this to programming languages as well.

As you can see... This is my way of fighting this problem. It's not perfect, but it's something and I'm happy with it!
